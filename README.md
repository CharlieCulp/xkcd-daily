# xkcd-daily

I like reading the web comic xkcd (www.xkcd.com), but I often forget to go to the site and read them. Also, I like to read them in order. This script solves both problems by emailing me a link daily to the next one. I have this set up as cron job so I don't need to have python constantly running and "sleeping" for 24  hours. The trick was how to get it to increment each day.
